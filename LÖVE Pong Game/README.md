<p>--This project is written by following <b>Harvard's CS50 A Taste of Game Development Live Seminars</b> using <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page">LÃ–VE Game Engine</a>--</b></p> 
<p>This project is written by following an tutorial. Recording of seminar can be found on that link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZXde3crVXI" target="_blank">A Taste of Game Development - CS50's New Year's Seminars 2021</a>.</p>
<h3>Definition of LUA</h3>
<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)" target="_blank">According to wikipedia</a></b> Lua is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C API to embed it into applications.</p>
<p>Since LUA is written for most likely to be used in embedded application, usage rate according to other popular languages like Java or Python is very low but because of it's power, LUA is still a great option for many programmers.</p>
<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">History of Pong Game</a></h5> 
<p>With this project, we have learned syntax of lua like defining variables and writing functions. Beside of modern game engines which includes easier options to detect collision with their built-in libraries, we have learned how to write an algorithm for collision detection. This was the hardest part of coding. Even this game seems pretty boring in today, while  thinking about the year of first development of pong game, it is really advanced technology according to its development year.</p>

<h3>Game Controlls</h3>
<p>The game can be played by two player simultaneously. To start a game we must hit "enter" key, after that we can serve the ball by hitting "enter" key again. Player one can use <b>"W" and "S"</b> keys to move their paddle, player two can use <b>"up arrow" and "down arrow"</b> keys to move their paddle. After every score we must hit "enter" key again to serve the ball. I didn't limited any score to finish game, so it is playable until you get bored.</p>
